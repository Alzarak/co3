# 🏛️ Council of 3 (co3)

**Council of 3** is a multi-agent coding framework designed to produce high-quality, production-ready code by leveraging three specialized AI perspectives in parallel. Instead of relying on a single agent, this approach synthesizes creative, accurate, and robust solutions into a single "Golden Version."

## 🚀 The Multi-Agent Philosophy

The system approaches every coding task through three distinct lenses simultaneously. By forcing these "agents" into extreme roles, we uncover solutions that a single balanced agent might overlook.

### 🎨 1. Creativity Agent
- **Focus**: Innovation, elegant designs, and modern patterns.
- **Priority**: Finding novel ways to solve problems and improving developer experience.
- [View Creativity Guide](references/creativity-agent.md)

### ✅ 2. Accuracy Agent
- **Focus**: Correctness, reliability, and best practices.
- **Priority**: Adhering to language idioms, type safety, and ensuring the code "just works."
- [View Accuracy Guide](references/accuracy-agent.md)

### 🛡️ 3. Edge Cases Agent
- **Focus**: Robustness, defensive programming, and boundary conditions.
- **Priority**: Planning for failure, security, and the unexpected.
- [View Edge Cases Guide](references/edge-cases-agent.md)

## 🛠️ Project Structure

The repository is organized to provide clear behavioral guidelines for each agent and the lead developer performing the synthesis.

- `Skill.md`: Core system instructions and the automated workflow for spawning agents.
- `references/`:
  - `creativity-agent.md`: Philosophy and guidelines for the Creativity Agent.
  - `accuracy-agent.md`: Philosophy and guidelines for the Accuracy Agent.
  - `edge-cases-agent.md`: Philosophy and guidelines for the Edge Cases Agent.
  - `synthesis-guide.md`: **Crucial guide** on how to blend the three outputs into a Golden Version.

## 🔄 The Workflow

1.  **Convene**: Present the coding task to all three agents in parallel.
2.  **Review**: Read the three independent outputs (stored in temporary files or provided by the orchestrator).
3.  **Synthesize**: Follow the [Synthesis Guide](references/synthesis-guide.md) to combine the outputs.
    *   **Foundation**: Accuracy Agent.
    *   **Enhancements**: Creativity Agent.
    *   **Protection**: Edge Cases Agent.
4.  **Produce**: Output the final "Golden Version" of the code.

## ⚖️ Synthesis Strategy

When agents disagree, the standard weighting depends on the target output:

| Context | Creativity | Accuracy | Edge Cases |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Prototypes** | 70% | 20% | 10% |
| **Production** | 15% | 35% | 50% |
| **Libraries** | 20% | 50% | 30% |

## 💬 Convene the Council

To use this methodology with an AI assistant, you can simply use the following trigger:

> *"Use the **Council of 3** approach to [your task here]. Show me the Golden Version after synthesizing the outputs from the three agents."*
