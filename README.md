# 🏛️ Council of 3 (co3)

**Council of 3** is a multi-agent coding framework designed to produce high-quality, production-ready code by leveraging three specialized AI perspectives in parallel. Instead of relying on a single agent, this approach synthesizes creative, accurate, and robust solutions into a single "Golden Version."

---

## 🚀 How It Works

The system spawns three parallel AI agents, each approaching your coding task through a different lens:

1.  🎨 **Creativity Agent**: Focuses on innovation, novel approaches, elegant designs, and modern patterns.
2.  ✅ **Accuracy Agent**: Focuses on correctness, reliability, established best practices, and maintainability.
3.  🛡️ **Edge Cases Agent**: Focuses on robustness, error handling, boundary conditions, and defensive programming.

Once all three agents complete their work, the outputs are formatted and ready for synthesis by the lead developer (you/Claude).

## 🛠️ Components

-   `scripts/council_orchestrator.py`: The Python orchestrator that manages parallel API calls to the agents.
-   `Skill.md`: Detailed documentation of the methodology and synthesis workflow.

## 📦 Installation

This project requires Python 3.8+ and the `aiohttp` library.

```bash
pip install aiohttp
```

## 🖥️ Usage

Run the orchestrator script with your coding task as an argument:

```bash
python scripts/council_orchestrator.py "Design a secure file upload handler in Python"
```

The orchestrator will:
1.  Convene the Council.
2.  Spawn the three agents in parallel.
3.  Return a JSON object containing the individual outputs and a formatted markdown summary.

## 🔄 The Workflow

1.  **Define**: Clearly state the coding task and constraints.
2.  **Orchestrate**: Run the `council_orchestrator.py` script.
3.  **Synthesize**: Review the three outputs and create a "Golden Version" that:
    *   Starts with the **Accuracy** foundation.
    *   Integrates **Creative** enhancements.
    *   Applies **Edge Case** robustness.
4.  **Deploy**: Use the final production-ready code.

## 📜 Principles

-   **Parallel Perspective**: Diverse viewpoints lead to better code.
-   **Defense in Depth**: Robustness is treated as a first-class citizen, not an afterthought.
-   **Innovation Balanced with Stability**: Creative solutions are validated against correctness.
